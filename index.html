We met the very first hour of the very first day of our pre-orientation program at Tufts University. We were friends throughout all of college, biking through Boston and Cambridge on the hunt for good seafood and constantly making Hodgdon Hall runs for the fresh made bread. We went on vacations together, made dinner together, and we definitely weren't dating.

After graduation, we planned a road trip across the country together. After 3 weeks of 24/7 hiking, driving, camping, and site seeing, we still didn't want to spend any time apart. Finally, we admitted our feelings to one another and went on our first date. It was full of laughter, hand holding, and some very adventurous Ethiopian food.

Four years after that first date, we were celebrating Adam's 27th birthday at one of our favorite Boston restaurants. After dessert, Adam got down on one knee in front of the entire restaurant and proposed. Even though I forgot to say yes, he took the vigorous nodding as a good sign that I was on board.

                      Adam (or as the bride and groom call him, Weeds,) has known Adam and Rachel as long as they have known each other. He was another member of that fateful pre-orientation group at Tufts. He and the groom bonded over their shared name and their shared love of absurd puns and Curb Your Enthusiasm references.

                      Jake is one of Adam's best friends from Tufts. The two lived together for the last two years of college, and their friendship is founded on an inordinate number of ridiculous jokes relived over bagels, lox, and cream cheese. Jake is renowned for making Adam giggle with his aggressive use of puns.

                      The groom and his future brother-in-law have bonded over the woes of having such a common name (although the groom is referred to as "Shep" in the Lew household). When he asked Adam to be one of his groomsmen, he responded, "Didn't I already agree to that?" -- so apparently it was always a given that he'd be on Team Groom.

                      As a frequent visitor of the Haskell hall suite shared by Rachel and Alex, Adam became an honorary member and quickly became friends with Alex. The two have traveled to India and Portugal together and have bonded over their love of silly games (SHEEEEEEEEP).

                      Zach and Adam met during senior year of college when Zach started dating the groom's and bride's close friend Ahnie. They bonded over SCIENCE, whiskey, and bad puns. While they were living on the same coast, Zach was Adam's go-to friend for evenings of ramen and afternoons of distillery tours.

                      Ahnie and Rachel share a love for computer science, adorable panda videos, and all things girly. She is one of both Rachel and Adam's best friends from Tufts, and there was definitely a bit of a battle to decide whose side of the aisle she'd be standing on.

                      Angie is Rachel's youngest cousin and yoga mentor. They share a love for fitness, cooking, and window shopping. On family vacations, you could often find the two trying to perfect a back flip or a handstand in between wave jumping adventures.

                      Alexa is one of Rachel's oldest and dearest friends. They met as 8 year olds on a gymnastics team and were best friends ever since. Years after the chalk clouds have settled, the two live on opposite coasts and sometimes opposing continents, but they still make sure to see each other at least once a year.

                      Gina is Rachel's oldest cousin as her senior of all of two months. The two were inseparable on family vacations and bonded over brightly colored bathing suits and jelly shoes. Gina taught Rachel how to do makeup and how to put an outfit together, and come to think of it, she's probably still trying to teach her those things.

Now living on opposite coasts, they have reunions in foreign countries when Rachel crashes his work trips.
